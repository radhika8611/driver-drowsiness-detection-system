The "Driver Drowsiness Detection Master" system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and computer 
vision techniques to monitor and analyze driver behavior in real-time. Utilizing a camera mounted on the 
dashboard, it captures facial features and eye movements, identifying signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye 
closure or yawning. The system processes this data using OpenCV and Python, triggering alerts to the driver 
through audio or visual signals when drowsiness is detected. This proactive approach aims to enhance road safety 
by preventing accidents caused by driver fatigue, ensuring timely interventions to keep drivers awake and alert.
